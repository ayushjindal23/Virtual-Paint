# Virtual-Paint
This code helps you track an object-of-interest to draw colored lines on the screen (just like the Paint application but using the webcam, which makes it both awesome and harder to draw simple things).

## Project Description
Given real-time camera input, this paint-like python application uses the OpenCV library to monitor an item-of-interest and allows the user to draw by moving the object, which makes drawing basic things both wonderful and challenging.

To perform video tracking an algorithm analyzes sequential video frames and outputs the movement of targets between the frames. There are a variety of algorithms, each having strengths and weaknesses. Considering the intended use is important when choosing which algorithm to use. There are two major components of a visual tracking system: target representation and localization, as well as filtering and data association.

Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing.

## Code Requirements
The code is in Python (version 3.6 or higher). You also need to install OpenCV library.

## Execution
To run the code, type
```
python Virtual Paint.py
```
